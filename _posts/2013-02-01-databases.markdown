For fun, my wife and I decided to take the [Databases course](https://class.coursera.org/db/class/index) on Coursera. I've got some thoughts.

When we first signed up for this class on Coursera, we noticed that it was listed as  
 I'm confused by the structure. On the left there's a list of topics we're going to cover, and they appear to have some sort of order. But, listening to the videos, it's clear that wasn't the order followed when she was filming the videos. It isn't much, and it doesn't get in the way of learning, but it's a little disconcerting to hear "As you remember from the SQL video" and to be thinking that video doesn't come for another two weeks.

And I'm also confused by the term "self-study". On Coursera, this course was listed as self study, which I thought was great, since I have a pretty good grasp of databases, and it meant we just do the assignments when it felt appropriate. But once I was in the course, I can't tell what self study meant. I still get emails about due dates and I still feel like I need to push to stay on top of things. But maybe that's just my failure to understand.

I'm a little confused by the content. Sure, it seems like a good portion of the content is about relational databases or relational algebra, but a good number of modules are on JSON or XML. I'm not sure how those are any more databases than PSDs or CSVs. Seems like they're data interchange formats, rather than databases.

And while we were learning about them, I was disappointed in how they were presented. We simply dived into JSON, as though JSON is the same thing as MySQL, and talked about different ways to query it and validate it. If I didn't know better, I'd assume that it was perfectly acceptable to store millions of records in a JSON file. Would it be so hard to just mention one or two real life JSON applications? Just so we have an idea.

I have similar complaints about XML. When we were developing DTD for XML documents, I couldn't help but wonder where these were actually used. I know there's a DTD for valid XHTML, and from that I can infer why you'd want to have a DTD for a widely used format. But that was never mentioned - we were just left to assume that DTDs or XSDs are almost always provided with XML documents, and it's totally normal to develop and validate these things by hand.
