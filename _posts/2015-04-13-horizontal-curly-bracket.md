Had a contest with someone at work the other day to do a strictly old CSS implementation of a horizontal curly bracket. Of course, now I'd probably look at writing a } character and rotating it, or just writing out an SVG, but this was a lot of fun. 

Here's a [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/cs8472f3/3/). Of course, I can only promise it works in Chrome 41 on my Mac.
