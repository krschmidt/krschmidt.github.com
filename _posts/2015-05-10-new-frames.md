A few years ago my father built us a frame for a big print of the [Adirondacks from Cascade](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RY4OULA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00RY4OULA&linkCode=as2&tag=maat10mp-20&linkId=JDTTILUB5BS4NQKR). After we repainted our living room, we wanted to put some pictures of our [trip](http://www.marriageat10mph.com) up on the wall next to it, but the frames they were in didn't match. Solution: $6 in poplar from Home Depot and an adventure in matching stains.

This project ended up using all the big clamps I had - those little clamps were just there to hold the butcher paper down so I didn't get glue on my assembly table surface.

It took an embarassing number of tries to get the right stain. But on the plus side, I shouldn't need to run to the store for new stain for a long time.
