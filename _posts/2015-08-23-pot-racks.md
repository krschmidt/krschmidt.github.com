When we first moved into our house, even though we had more kitchen cabinets than I knew what to do with (at the time!), we still lacked a good, accessible place to store all of our pots. And, for whatever reason, the previous owners had decided to paint the entire room canary yellow &ndash; ok in small doses, but oppressive on entire walls. To fix both these problems, I decided to install a wall mounted pot rack on the biggest yellow wall.

Some wall mounted pot racks are pretty reasonable. For instance, [this one](http://amzn.to/1EPTjmf) isn't too bad. And [this one](http://amzn.to/1hUMdrT) would have been great if I'd had the space for a shelf. But I needed something longer, ideally about 60 inches, and to be as close to the wall as possible. Even if I'd had the money for something [long enough](http://amzn.to/1hUMDys), it still would have come too far out from the wall. So, I opted to build my own.

I already had some little wooden blocks and a stain that looked pretty close to my cabinets. So I bought an [aluminum bar](http://amzn.to/1EPTQVr) (cheaper at Lowes) and some stainless screws. Here's the finished result:

Each of the three wooden blocks actually has two screws into studs. One is stainless, and holds the bar against the wood. The other is just a 2&frac12; inch drywall screw that sits under the bar, and helps to carry the weight and keep the wooden block from rotating.

We used [these hooks](http://amzn.to/1MNtMT1), and now almost three years later we've still got a pot rack that only cost us $30 and is perfectly sized to the wall. So, last week, when a long time friend of mine moved to the area and needed some more space in her kitchen, it was time to build another one.

Since I recently replaced my cordless, I gave them my [old one](http://amzn.to/1EeaeUQ) (link is to the closest comparable model I could find), which even though it's almost 15 years old, still had enough juice to drill some holes in the aluminum.

I think they had a pretty awesome final result:
