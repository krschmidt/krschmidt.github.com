I'm sure we've all read the studies about how sitting all day is killing us. Since much of what I need to do each day revolves around sitting, I thought I'd try a DIY treadmill desk.

My first attempt only had the bottom level, but it was enough to prove the concept to me. I wrote a few pages of a paper while walking about a mile (at a brisk 1.2mph), but even with the computer sitting atop a couple big books, things were too low. So tonight, I added the second layer.

Though it's actually wedged between the supports fairly well, I was still worried that eventually the desk would shake itself loose. So I drilled two holes and ran some rope to strap the desk onto the treadmill.

There's about six inches of space between the two layers, and though it's a lot more comfortable to type on now, the monitor of the laptop is still low. To fix that, we'll soon be installing a [mount](http://amzn.to/1ObKyvE) and [monitor](http://amzn.to/1ObKvQs) on the wall.
