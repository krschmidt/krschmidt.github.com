About two years ago, I thought I'd try to [DIY Streetview](http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/12/create-your-own-street-view.html) the [Lane](https://www.lanecc.edu) campus. In order to make sure I was always shooting from the exact same placed, I needed to use a tripod, but I was missing a way to mount my tablet. Rather than [spend $10](http://amzn.to/1hVLyG5) and wait two days for it to arrive, I put something together using scrap in my garage.

Back of my Nexus 7 in the stand:

Front (camera side) of my Nexus 7 in the stand:

I used my table saw &ndash; new to me at the time &ndash; to cut tracks in a couple pieces of pine to slide the tablet in.

This project also saw my first ever attempt at dove tails. The only saw I had was my [Stanley](http://amzn.to/1hVNJJI), which hasn't been sharp in some time, and which is more than just a little bit too large. The first one didn't come out so great.

But I either got better or got lucky by the end.

Just had to add a T-Nut, and I was ready to mount to our tripods. The holes at top left and right are due to that track I cut on my tablesaw to slide the tablet down - unfortunately, they ran right through my joint.

Due to construction and surprising brevity of my battery, which meant I only photographed half of campus, my attempt at DIY Streetview never went live. But now that we've launched our [new maps site](http://map.lanecc.edu) we have much spiffier panoramic photos, taken with a much nicer camera, by a much better photographer.
