This year marks 25 years of friendship with an old friend of mine. As he just had his first kid and enjoys working in a wood shop himself, I thought I'd get both my friend and his daughter a gift they could enjoy together.

Though my last few robots were made of pine, this one is maple for the added beauty and durability. Though I usually only pass one rope through the head, I was curious how things would turn out with a couple of ropes. Since this robot was for a little girl, it seemed like a good fit. I'm pretty happy with how it came out.

As she's not even a year old yet, she's much too young to actually play with this robot yet. But I'm hoping it'll last for the next twenty years - provided their dog doesn't get to it first.

All my robots are in the [imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/zc7VB).
