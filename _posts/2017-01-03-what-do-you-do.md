Since the start of our quest toward [minimalism]({% post_url 2016-08-06-thoughts-on-minimalism %}), I've been listening to a podcast by [The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com/). While it's grown a bit repetitive (they keep introducing new people to minimalism, and thus repeat the same stories a lot), it's been a great reminder that minimalism isn't just about possessions, and helpful overall. 

One of their recurring threads is about the question "What do you do?" Here's an excerpt from [their essay](http://www.theminimalists.com/do/) on that question:

>Once you scrape away its cheap gold-plating, however, you’ll find a series of irksome inquisitions lurking beneath the surface. Sadly, what we’re actually asking when we posit this malefic question, albeit unknowingly, is:
>
>How do you earn a paycheck? How much money do you make? What is your socioeconomic status? And based on that status, where do I fall on the socioeconomic ladder compared to you? Am I a rung above you? Below you? How should I judge you? Are you worth my time?

I just don't see it.

I think people ask this question because it's safe and they're scared. Silence, especially with strangers, is terrifying. We look for questions that are politically and culturally inoffensive, but relevant to anyone. There's whole web pages [full of them](https://www.themuse.com/advice/48-questions-thatll-make-awkward-small-talk-so-much-easier). The what you do question meets all these requirements.

The what you do question also sets up two follow ups. First, you get to ask me the same question, which gives us a start to conversation. Second, once I know what you do, I can ask you a follow up related to whatever you do. If you tell me you're a bike messenger, I can ask you what you ride. If you sell homes, I can ask you about the local market. If you sell cars, I can ask you for advice on how to buy one.

Also, unlike the Minimalists, most of us are still working traditional 9-5 jobs, and minimalist or not, we're still networking to try and get ahead. Asking the what do you do question helps to create network opportunities. The bike messenger might help me identify a great way to ride around town, or might want to buy that old bike in the garage. The Realtor might have a house that'd be perfect for me, or he might need someone to help with his website. The car salesman might have the car I've been looking for, or he might be willing to give me some advice on selling mine. 

Most of us have a canned answer to the what do you do question. That's a good thing, because most of us are at least a little on edge when meeting someone new, and already knowing what you're going to say helps alleviate that fear.

The what do you do question also helps me put you in a box, though not necessarily in a socioeconomic one. I just want to have more ideas about things you might like, so I can figure out what we have in common. For instance, in my head, accountants like board games (probably because of [Parks and Rec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfXfOCIIFcY)). Bike messengers can probably talk craft beer. And used car salesmen? Well, they just seem a little sleazy and maybe I should watch what they're selling. It's a heuristic, wrong or not, that helps me form a mental model of you as fast as possible. 

The Minimalists instead suggest asking:

>There is a better way to answer this dangerous query, though: by changing the question altogether.
>
>The next time someone asks what you do, try this: Don’t give them your job title. Instead, tell them what you’re passionate about, and then change course by asking them what they are passionate about:
>
>“What do you do?” asks the stranger.
>
>“I’m passionate about writing (or rock climbing or sailing or input accounting),” you say, followed by, “What are you passionate about?”

Honestly, if that's how you answer, I'm first going to wonder why you're so averse to a question everyone else is fine with. And I'm going to be a little put off by the fact that you didn't answer the question I asked, without any explanation why. 

This question does, of course, also let you do all the "bad" things: judge how much money someone makes, rank myself against them, judge them. Maybe for the type of people who become [high level executives in the telecommunications industry](http://www.theminimalists.com/quit/), that's the case. But for the rest of us, I have to believe people aren't that judgmental, and are mostly just worried about making small talk.
