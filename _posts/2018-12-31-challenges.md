I carry a little [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) around with me (I use a [Rhodia](http://amzn.to/2Fo9puK)). Over the last several years, I've been recording various challenges I thought would improve me. This year, after a New Year's Eve conversation with [Jillian](http://www.jillianschmidt.com), we decided to give the challenges a try.

## Monthly Challenges

The rules were simple. Every month I'd start a new challenge. Every challenge I would do for at least 100 days, so that it'd become a habit, rather than just a challenge. At the end, I'd evaluate if I wanted to keep doing it. 

### January: Reflection

Early on, I struggled with actually reflecting on my entire day. During the first week, I often journaled, or just reflected on the end of my day. But I eventually hit a groove. 

Around Day 26, I forgot to do a reflection for the first time. On Day 28, when I resumed again, I forced myself to go back through and review what had happened each day and write something down. It was surprisingly helpful. That might have been because I was forced to get the notebook out of my bag and actually use it. Since I had it out anyway, I found myself writing down tasks and getting things out of my head.

I struggled to review reflections. Around day 40 I realized I should have reviewed them at the end of the month, and didn't actually review anything until day 65. By then, it had been long enough the reflections had lost some of their saliency. 

I'll update this chart a few times before the end of this challenge.

### February: Bedtime Tracking
<span style="font-style: italic">Write down what time I decide to go to bed.</span>

I'd been having some trouble getting to bed at a reasonable hour. With a toddler at home, a few hours at night to work uninterrupted on something is incredibly valuable. But sleeping well is important as well. Rather than challenging myself to get sleep, I tracked when I went to bed, as something quantifiable.

Google Sheets doesn't provide great labeling options, and in order to show, say, a 1AM bedtime on a Tuesday as being the bed time for a Monday I had to swap AM and PM. I promise I don't go to bed around noon every day.

At the time I last updated this post, in mid march, I'm yet to feel an impact from this challenge. This may be the type of thing where a smart watch is more useful.

### March: Daily Exercise
<span style="font-style: italic">Do at least twenty minutes of aerobic activity, every day.</span>

After a discouraging blood pressure reading at the dentist, I realized I needed to exercise more. Before we had a kid, I used to ride my bike to work every day. But now, between grad school and toddler time, an hour and a half per day just to commute is hard to justify. This challenge was to get me moving at least a little bit, as long as I'm driving to work.

So far, I've mostly been walking the dog at night. 

## Annual Challenges
In addition to the monthly challenges, I had a couple of annual goals for myself. I'd already been experimenting with them, but wanted to commit to them for a year.

### Used Clothing Only
While I certainly don't buy much clothing, I wanted to reduce my impact even further, due to concerns about the [true cost](http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/22/news/economy/true-cost-clothing/index.html) of [cheap clothing](https://qz.com/1222569/fast-fashion-is-causing-an-environmental-emergency/). With a couple of exceptions (undershirts, socks, and underwear), this year I resolved to buy only used clothing. So far, I've been successful, purchasing mostly higher quality clothing used on [swap.com](https://refer.swap.com/s/swap9).

I'm unsure of the environmental impact of my shipping and returns, but feel it can't be greater than the cost of manufacturing something new.

### Intermittent Fasting
I've been doing this on and off for a while, but I decided to get serious about intermittent fasting. There's [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680567/) to suggest it might be a good idea, and I've had some weight I could afford to lose for a while. I entered the year at 195lbs. By February 17th, I was down to 189. Now, in early March, I'm at 186. 

After starting with a 16 hours fasting, 8 hours non-fasting schedule, I moved to 17 hours fasting, 7 hours non-fasting in mid January. Other than a few outlying days, where I got busy at work and accidentally fasted 19 hours, I've had no problems with energy levels or hunger so far.
