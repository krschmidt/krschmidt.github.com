As I enjoy cooking ([for instance]({% post_url 2016-12-18-timpano %})), I have quite a few spices. For several years I lived with a poor solution: a small wire wall mounted rack which held about 20 jars, a wooden standing rack which held maybe 16, and a shelf which held overflow. After one too many times struggling to find the right jar, I finally took the time to solve the problem.

The backing is an old piece of project board, and the rest is some old red oak from the [ReStore](https://www.habitat.org/restores). While the shelves are attached to the sides with dado joints, the front uses nails as accents.

The new rack's capacity? 63 jars. Plenty of space.
