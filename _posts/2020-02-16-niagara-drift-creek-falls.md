One of my resolutions after my [last trip]({% post_url 2019-10-06-diamond-peak %}) was to get out into the woods a bit more. Almost immediately after that trip, [Mike](http://mikepsarisweis.com/) and I started an email conversation to find a location for a spring trip. But some unexpected good weather in late January led us to pick a much earlier weekend, and we found a weekend to head out in the middle of February. 

After an unreasonable number of emails, we had a plan. To the northwest of Detroit, Oregon there's a bit of forest with the [Phantom Natural Bridge](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Phantom_Natural_Bridge_Hike), [Natural Arch](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Natural_Arch_Hike), and the [Rocky Top Lookout](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Rocky_Top_Hike). We'd meet up in Mill City, OR, have breakfast, then find a place to camp and come back late the next day.

But as the weekend approached, the weather got worse. Suddenly the forecast was calling for several feet of snow in the mountains and inches of rain in the valley. Everywhere, from the Olympics to the Redwoods, was in for a very damp weekend. 

Several feet of snow can be great conditions for certain activities outdoors, but unfortunately they're the ones I don't have the gear for. So I searched for a hardshell jacket to keep dry in, whether we were snowshoeing, mountain climbing, or just hiking in the rain. As Patagonia was running a half off sale, a new [Pluma Jacket](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-pluma-alpine-jacket/83755.html) was soon on its way. I also had to replace my boots, which I'd discovered on the last trip were falling apart. While I'd ordered a pair of [Merrell Trail Glove 4s](https://amzn.to/2Urb6jR) a while earlier, they weren't going to help if we hit snow. I purchased the only waterproof minimalist boots at REI, just a few days before the trip: [Altra Long Peak 4 RSMs](https://amzn.to/39fLVq0). 

Of course, shoes and a jacket weren't going to be enough for an actual winter trip. I only have a 3 season tent, a lightweight air pad, and a 30 degree bag. With the weekend rapidly approaching, we started to think our Detroit trip wasn't going to work out. We'd likely spend hours stuck under a tarp, listening to the rain, just trying to stay warm. So after another twenty emails, we came up with a new plan. Rather than try to camp, we'd just meet in Salem, leave a car at the REI there, and then head out to do [Niagara and Pheasant Creek Falls](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Niagara_Falls_Hike), and with enough time, then do [Drift Creek Falls](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Drift_Creek_Falls_Hike), before returning to Salem for dinner and the drive home. It'd be a short trip, but one we could do in any amount of rain.

The morning of, I loaded up the car and headed north to clear skies. While Saturday had been damp, by Sunday things had started to clear, and by the time we got the Niagara Falls trailhead, it was shaping up to be a beautiful day. 

The parking area at the Niagara Falls trailhead was fairly small, but had plenty of space. Two cars pulled in right after us and didn't notice the little trailhead on the left side of the parking area, leading to both car's occupant's taking a long detour down a logging road. The hike was short, but quiet, and disappointingly dry.

We also grabbed our only selfie of the trip.

While probably only an hour, it was a pleasant hour, and not terribly far off NF-85. Back at the car, we first went west to US-101, before turning south to look for food. While we'd thought about stopping in Neskowin, we wound up at the [Otis Pizzeria](https://otispizzeria.com/). While small, it offered a a good amount of food for the price, and their recommendations were spot on. 

On to Drift Creek Falls. The parking area was very full, even on a day originally projected to have terrible weather, with cars parked on the side of the road. This parking area, being quite a bit more developed, required a fee, and since neither of us had thought to grab a forest pass, we'd planned to simply pay the requisite $5 when we got there. However, it'd been such a busy day that there were no envelopes left, leaving me to film myself putting the $5 into the receptacle, just to have some evidence to show that we had paid if ticketed. 

The highlight of the trip was the bridge, 100' above the gorge below.

It swayed a little bit when on it, but a lot less than the [one in Frederick](https://www.bridgemeister.com/pic.php?pid=125) used to. 

Down at the bottom of the gorge was a great view of an 85' waterfall under the bridge.

While not a long hike, it was certainly a nice one, and one I'd be glad to do again with the family. We returned to Salem, too late to stop at the REI, but with plenty of time for a dinner and a desert at [Gustav's Bargarden](https://bargarten.com/).
