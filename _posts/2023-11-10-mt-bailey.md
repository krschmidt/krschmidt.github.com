November, in Eugene, is almost perfect. It's cool at night, but warm enough during the day. The rains start to come back, bringing an end to fire season. And there's a couple long weekends that are perfect times to adventure into the wilderness.

Mike (of several past adventures) and I decided to get a  late season trip in. After too much discussion, we landed on Mount Bailey, which had a couple of appeals. First, at only 8300 feet, we were hopeful there'd be a lot less snow.

Second, we were hopeful we could drive all the way to the [Hemlock Butte Ski Cabin](https://www.fs.usda.gov/r06/umpqua/recreation/hemlock-butte-cabin). And, because we hadn't seen much snow, we thought it'd be fairly empty, and at only $6, it felt like an impossibly good deal.

But we were late leaving town. By the time we were were on OR-138 (of [previous adventures]({% post_url 2015-10-25-n-umpqua %})), near Toketee Falls, the sun was already low. We switched to our backup plan, and grabbed a site at Clearwater Falls Campground. It was a perfect fall evening.

Early the next morning, we drove to the trailhead and confirmed that there was now snow at all. Optimistic, we left our snowshoes in the car rather than carry them up the mountain. That was a mistake.

Views on the way to the ski cabin were fantastic.

But there was a lot of snow. And it just kept getting deeper. By the time we made it to the ski cabin, it was to mid shin.

The cabin itself was fairly rustic, but in a good way. It'd have been a colder night than camping in our hammocks, but not an unpleasant one. 

We continued on.

Soon the snow was over our knees. 

And then, as we reached the crater, the snow came to mid-thigh. Exhausted, near soaked through, and running out of daylight, we called it quits.

The return trip was much faster since not only were we headed downhill, but we had our own trail to follow.

Yet another trip with lessons learned. But not a bad way to spend a weekend.
