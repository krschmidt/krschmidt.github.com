<p>After 6 years of teaching programming, networking, and computer repair at a high school in suburban DC, I packed my stuff and moved to Eugene, Oregon. Currently, Iâ€™m a web developer at <a href="http://www.lanecc.edu">Lane Community College</a>, where I do all sorts of things related to the web. When I'm not at work, you'll probably find me either hiking with my dog or building furniture in my garage.</p>

<p>After getting married in May of 2009, my wife and I took a honeymoon bicycle trip across the country, discovering many wonderful places and even more wonderful people. You can see that website at <a href="http://www.marriageat10mph.com">http://www.marriageat10mph.com</a>.</p>
