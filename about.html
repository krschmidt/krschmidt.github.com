<h1>About</h1>

<img src="/img/threeofus.jpg" class="right" style="margin: 0 0 5px 5px">

<p>After 6 years of teaching programming, networking, and computer repair at a high school in suburban DC, I packed my stuff and moved to Eugene, Oregon. Currently, Iâ€™m a web developer at <a href="http://www.lanecc.edu">Lane Community College</a>, where I do all sorts of things related to the web. When I'm not at work, you'll probably either find me out on my bicycle somewhere.</p>

<p>After getting married in May of 2009, my wife and I took a honeymoon bicycle trip across the country, discovering many wonderful places and even more wonderful people. You can see that website at <a href="http://www.marriageat10mph.com">http://www.marriageat10mph.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can contact me by email at <a href="mailto:ks@kyleschmidt.com">ks@kyleschmidt.com</a></p>

<p>My mom is always trying to find this link to my <a href="http://amzn.com/w/14XQSILM20RRN">Amazon Wish List</a></p>
