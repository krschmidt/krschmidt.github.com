<p>After six years teaching high school students to program, network, and repair computers in suburban DC, I packed my stuff and moved to Eugene, Oregon. Currently, Iâ€™m a web developer and higher ed professional at <a href="http://www.lanecc.edu">Lane Community College</a>, where I do all sorts of things related to the web, student recruitment, and student retention. When I'm not at work, you'll probably find me either hiking with my dog or building furniture in my garage.</p>
<p>After getting married in 2009, my <a href="http://jillianschmidt.com">wife</a> and I took a cross-country honeymoon bicycle trip, discovering many wonderful places and even more wonderful people. You can read about our trip at <a href="http://www.marriageat10mph.com">http://www.marriageat10mph.com</a>.</p>
