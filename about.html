<p>I'm a web developer and digital content strategist, working at <a href="https://www.lanecc.edu">Lane Community College</a> in Eugene, Oregon. Like most community college employees, my daily work life has a lot of variety, and I've discovered a passion for digital accessibility, college governance and policy, and student recruitment and retention efforts. I occasionally <a href="https://blogs.lanecc.edu/webteam">blog professionally</a>. Outside of work, you'll probably find me hiking with my dog, building furniture in my garage, or cooking things that I should know better than to try doing on a weeknight.</p>

<p>From 2006 to 2011, I taught high school students to program, network, and repair computers at a <a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/">large, award-winning school district</a> in suburban Washington, DC. While there I built and deployed my first web application, to collect and evaluate student programming assignments. Writing my <a href="http://krschmidt.github.io/playingwithsnakes">own class materials.</a> started my lifelong belief in the power of Open Educational Resources.</p>

<p>After getting married in 2009, my <a href="http://jillianschmidt.com">wife</a> and I took a cross-country honeymoon trip on a <a href="https://hasebikes.com/95-1-Tandem-PINO-ALLROUND.html">half-recumbent tandem bicycle</a>, discovering many wonderful places and even more wonderful people. You can read about our trip, from either of our perspectives, at <a href="http://www.marriageat10mph.com">marriageat10mph.com</a>.</p>

<p>We're documenting our adventures raising our son, Hudson, at <a href="http://www.parentingat10mph.com">parentingat10mph.com</a>. Email either Jillian or me for an invite.</p>
